.idea and .iml files
 They are generated by intelli-j IDEA and acts as a form of version control. It is very IDE-dependent and makes it a little difficult when working with other IDEs. Also, we are already using maven as a form of version control so we don't need these 2 files.

/target
This folder is generated on building the project, so it is redundant to keep it around.
